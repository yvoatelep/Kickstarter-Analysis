# Kickstarter-Analysis
## Overview of Project
The goal of this analysis is to examine Kickstarter campaigns similar to Fever (Theater/ Plays) that were successful, in terms of the goals they had set  as well as by launch date.

### Purpose
To learn if campaigns with higher goals had a greater or lesser chance of success. To find a goal range in which campaigns were most likely to succeed, and to see if there are months in which a campaign is more likely to be successful.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
According to the data collected, May, June, and July are the best times to begin a campaign. The winter months, or holiday seasons, are poorer times. 67% of the campaigns launched in May and June were successful, compared with 49% of those started in December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In general, campaigns with lower goals tend to have more success. In our data set, around 74 % of those projects with goals less than $5000 were successful. As goals rise, the success rate tends to decrease. However, there is a jump in success rates in projects with goals between $35000 and $45000

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One challenge in this analysis is that that the data sets for projects with higher goals are very small. The jump in success in the $35 to $45K range is probably the result of this small data set. There were only 9 total projects in this range, so the small number that were successful make up  a very large percentage. Additionally, there is a lot of qualitative information in this data set that isnâ€™t being analyzed here, and which would be subjective and time consuming to comb through. For example, a very large project with a clearly viable project, such as a play that had been successful in another venue and was raising money to mount a new production, might be successful. At the same time, a small project with an unlikely sounding summary might not attract even a small number of contributions and therefore would fail. With this data set, the numbers only tell us so much. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
--Launch a project between May and July for best results. Do not launch a project in December, as chances of its success at that time are very limited. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? 
--It is advisable to set a goal as low as possible to fund your project. Projects with goals under $20K are much more likely to succeed, and those under $5K are by far the most successful.  

- What are some limitations of this dataset? 
--A limitation is there is a lot of qualitative data included, which could be very useful, but is hard to quantify. Some of the data points have very small data sets and few conclusions can be drawn. There are some projects with massive donors. It would be useful to go through this data and eliminate those outliers and then run this analysis again.  

-Suggestions for further analysis
-- It might be helpful to take a sampling of the successful projects and try to examine the project description to see if there are similarities or certain types of projects that are more likely to succeed. (Genre, size of cast, location, etc.) A bar graph showing the goals and the actual amount of money raised might show more about how more expensive projects fare in Kickstarter.
